## IMPORTANT: this project is abandoned

***Apple released their own WWDC app for tvOS, so this app is not necessary anymore.***

# WWDC app for the new Apple TV

## Build Instructions

* Important: building requires Xcode 7.1.1 or later.

* To run this on an actual Apple TV you must have a paid developer account.

The only steps required before you build is to pull down the code and submodules:

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC-tvOS.git
	
## AppStore?

I do not intend to put this on the AppStore, Apple would probably reject It and they're probably working on an official WWDC app anyway. This is just a temporary solution for those who want to watch sessions on their new Apple TV ;)
